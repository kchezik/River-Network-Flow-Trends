	Abstract = {[1]~Changes in air temperature, precipitation, and, in some cases, glacial runoff affect the timing of river flow in watersheds of western Canada. We present a method to detect streamflow phase shifts in pluvial, nival, and glacial rivers. The {Kendall-Theil} robust lines yield monotonic trends in normalized sequent 5-day means of runoff in nine river basins of western Canada over the period 1960--2006. In comparison to trends in the timing of the date of annual peak flow and the center of volume, two other less robust metrics often used to infer streamflow timing changes, our approach reveals more detailed structure on the nature of these changes. For instance, our trend analyses reveal extension of the warm hydrological season in nival and glacial rivers of western Canada. This feature is marked by an earlier onset of the spring melt, decreases in summer streamflow, and a delay in the onset of enhanced autumn flows. Our method provides information on streamflow timing changes throughout the entire hydrological year, enhancing results from previous methods to assess climate change impacts on the hydrological cycle.},

@article{Wang:2012,
	Abstract = { AbstractThis study addresses the need to provide comprehensive historical climate data and climate change projections at a scale suitable for, and readily accessible to, researchers and resource managers. This database for western North America (WNA) includes over 20 000 surfaces of monthly, seasonal, and annual climate variables from 1901 to 2009; several climate normal periods; and multimodel climate projections for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. A software package, ClimateWNA, allows users to access the database and query point locations, obtain time series, or generate custom climate surfaces at any resolution. The software uses partial derivative functions of temperature change along elevation gradients to improve medium-resolution baseline climate estimates and calculates biologically relevant climate variables such as growing degree-days, number of frost-free days, extreme temperatures, and dryness indices. Historical and projected future climates are obtained by using monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies to adjust the interpolated baseline data for the location of interest. All algorithms used in the software package are described and evaluated against observations from weather stations across WNA. The downscaling algorithms substantially improve the accuracy of temperature variables over the medium-resolution baseline climate surfaces. Climate variables that are usually calculated from daily data are estimated from monthly climate variables with high statistical accuracy. },
